# Rock-paper-scissors--python
THis is a game of rock paper scissors written in python.
In this I have imported colorama to make the game more attractive.
This game shows you the score of the match once you leave the game.
After each game of match it asks you wether to conttinue the match or leave.
This game basically works with conditions, functions, loops.
